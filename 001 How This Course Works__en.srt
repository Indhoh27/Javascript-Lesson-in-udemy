00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,990
Hey, everyone, welcome to the course.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:02,850
My name is Colts'.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,440
Thank you for joining us.

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,990
So I'm really excited about this cause honestly more excited than I've been about pretty much any Udemy

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,220
cause I've put out so far.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,080
I'm excited for a couple of reasons.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,079
I'll go into first of all, I just like JavaScript.

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,490
It's a very fun topic to teach.

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,650
We can do a lot of really cool things with it.

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,660
And this course covers everything.

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,930
JavaScript, it's a ton of JavaScript that we talk about from the very basics up to some pretty complex

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,500
projects.

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,820
So what I want to start with here is a rough overview of how the course works.

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,750
The course is pretty unique in how it's structured.

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,770
There are two distinct parts.

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,710
The first part is a start to finish introduction to JavaScript for beginners, starting from the very,

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,100
very basics of getting set up variables up to more complex topics like dominant relation and events,

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,950
all the latest features and javascript, things like era functions, promises, and then part two of

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,070
the course is focused exclusively on projects.

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,370
So those projects include lots of new topics, things like node or express or creating your own database.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,530
Lots of really fun things coming up.

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,090
But there is a distinction.

23
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,580
Here's another visual, the same idea.

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,940
We've got the building blocks first, starting from the very basics.

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,430
And then part two is all projects.

26
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,820
So to take this course, you have a couple different options if you are a complete beginner, you don't

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,650
really know JavaScript, then start at the beginning, start with the basics, make your way through

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,480
the first 20 ish sections and then move on to all the projects.

29
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,470
If you're someone who has some JavaScript experience, maybe you've taken one of my courses already

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,580
or a similar course.

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,720
You may not need to start at the very beginning.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,450
So what you could do is jump right into the projects and just start building something.

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,670
There's almost 20 hours of projects in this course, and if you do happen to hit a wall, you run into

34
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,060
trouble.

35
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,370
You can go back to the first part of the course and just review the parts that you need to if you need

36
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:02,070
to review error functions or async functions or the spread operator or some newer features in JavaScript

37
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,450
that that maybe weren't covered in the last course you saw on JavaScript.

38
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,020
That's a great option for you.

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,039
Start with the projects and then reference the first part of the course whenever necessary.

40
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,740
So that's how the course is structured.

41
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,070
We've got two main parts.

42
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,190
I think there's something here for I want to say everyone.

43
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,110
There's probably not anything here for someone who doesn't care about JavaScript, but for anyone who

44
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,790
is interested in JavaScript, whether you have no experience, whether you've taken one of my courses

45
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,440
or Stephen's courses and you're just looking to build projects, there's something here for you.
